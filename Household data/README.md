# Exploratory Data Analysis of Household Electric Power Consumption

## Project Overview
This repository contains the R scripts and plots for the course project of the Exploratory Data Analysis course. The goal of the project is to analyze the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically focusing on data from February 1st and 2nd, 2007. The task involves creating visualizations to understand how energy usage varies over this 2-day period.

## Dataset Description
The dataset represents measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. The variables included in the dataset are:

- **Date**: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- **Time**: Time in format hh:mm:ss
- **Global_active_power**: Household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
- **Global_reactive_power**: Household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
- **Voltage**: Minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
- **Global_intensity**: Household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
- **Sub_metering_1**: Energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy)
- **Sub_metering_2**: Energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy)
- **Sub_metering_3**: Energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy)

Missing values in the dataset are coded as `?`.

## Plots
The repository includes four plots:

- `plot1.png`: Histogram of Global Active Power.
- `plot2.png`: Line plot of Global Active Power vs. Time.
- `plot3.png`: Line plot showing Energy Sub Metering.
- `plot4.png`: Multi-panel plot with various energy consumption metrics over time.

Each plot is generated by its corresponding R script (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R`, `plot4.R`). The scripts include all the necessary code to read, preprocess, and plot the data.

## Running the Scripts
To reproduce the plots, run each R script file in R or RStudio. Set your working directory to the location of the scripts and the data file:

```R
setwd(" path to your directory ")
Make sure to add Plot folder inside the directory
